# **App Name**: TeleVerse

## Core Features:

- API Authentication: Connect to Telegram Bot API using a user-provided API token obtained from @BotFather.
- Command Handling: Implement placeholders for handling Telegram bot commands. The bot should be ready to register and execute commands through future development.
- Initialization Message: Display a welcome message when the bot is initialized.
- Command Feedback: Display informative messages when a command placeholder is triggered, explaining that the command is not yet implemented.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark Indigo (#4B0082) to create a mysterious and intellectual feel.
- Background color: Very light lavender (#F0E6FF) for a subtle contrast that does not distract from the content.
- Accent color: Plum (#DDA0DD) to add a touch of elegance and draw attention to important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a humanist serif, provides an elegant and intellectual feel suitable for bot messaging.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a set like 'Feather' or 'Octicons' to represent bot commands.
- Employ a clean, single-column layout to mirror Telegram's messaging format, ensuring clarity and ease of use.
- Use subtle fade-in effects on messages.
